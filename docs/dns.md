# DNS
DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that translates human-readable domain names, like www.example.com, into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. Essentially, it acts as the internet's phonebook, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numeric IP addresses.

## Configure DNS
Add two types of DNS records for every subdomain:
* A
* AAAA

### Example
Type: A  
Name: www  
Value: 00.000.00.000

Type: AAAA  
Name: www  
Value: ::
